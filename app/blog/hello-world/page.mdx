# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

This is my space to share build logs and notes:

- WeeklyBuddy (Slack AI meeting-prep bot)
- Data Quality toolkit (dedupe & fuzzy match)
- A* stealth pathfinding experiments

**Goal:** ship small things weekly, measure impact, and write it down so I (and recruiters) can see progress.
